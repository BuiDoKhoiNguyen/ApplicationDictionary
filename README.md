### Introduce

Welcome to our innovative Dictionary Application, where 
learning English becomes an engaging and interactive 
experience. We've designed a feature-packed app that not 
only serves as your go-to dictionary but also adds an 
element of fun to your language learning journey.
1. The application is designed to support learning English.
2. The application is written in Java and uses the JavaFX library.
3. You will have a new experience when using this application.
4. You can search paragraph in many languages.
### Applied_technology
***
   Our project utilizes Java, JavaFX, and SceneBuilder to create a feature-rich dictionary application. 
   
1. `seamlessly integrating with a database server`.
2. `employing multithreading in programming`.
3. `leveraging Google's and OpenAI API for paragraph translation`.


we've crafted a robust platform that enhances the language learning experience.

### Feature
***

   Outline about my project, it has some funtions like:
1. `search word`. 
2. `add favourite word`.
3. `watch your profile`.
4. `translate paragraph`.
5. `make your own account`.
6. `translaste image to text`.
7. `translate record to text`.
8. `play and learn word`.
9. `Daily word`.

I don't want to reveal all the functional details, just trying to discover our dictionary app, and hope you have enjoyable time with it. Here is demo about our project:
